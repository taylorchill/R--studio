# Tibbles and Tibbles

In this activity, you will make two tibbles. Create the first tibble column by column, then create the second tibble row by row.

## Instructions

The instructions are divided into two parts, plus a bonus.

### Part 1: Create a Tibble by Columns

* Use the `tibble()` function to create a tibble with four children, whose names and ages are the following:

  * Aarohi, 12 years old
  * Mithra, 11 years old
  * Dae, 10 years old
  * Makoa, 7 years old

* Aarohi, Mithra, Dae, and Makoa are students at an after-school drama club in Hawaii. They must wait until they are 25 years old to be able to rent a car.

* Create a tibble with each child's name, age, and years remaining until they can legally rent a car.

### Part 2: Create a Tibble by Rows

* Using the `tribble()` function, create a tibble based on the following table:.

| Name | Birth Year | Age Received Driver's License | First Car |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tan Han Soon | 1982 | 19 | Myvi |
| Mandawuy Burarrwanga | 1975 | 17 | Holden |
| Ichika Tanaka | 1986 | 20 | Honda |
| Jada Freeman | 1967 | 18 | Chevrolet |
| Fernando Diaz | 1992 | 19 | Ford |


* Create five rows. Each row in your Tibble should contain `Name`, `Age Received Driver’s License`, and `First Car`.

### Part 3: Bonus

* In the first tibble, add a row for Salvatore, aged 15. You will need to research how to add a row to a tibble.

* In the second tibble, add a column for `Birth Year`. You will need to research how to add a column to a tibble.
