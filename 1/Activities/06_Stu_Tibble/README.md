# Back to School

In this activity, you’ll use a dataset similar to the one from your PySchools homework assignment.

## Instructions

* Use [students.csv](Resources/students.csv) to identify the following information about the dataset, using only R this time:

  * Create a list of all schools.

  * Calculate the total count of schools.

  * Calculate the total number of students.

  * Calculate the average reading and math scores.

  * Calculate the percentage of students with passing reading scores (scores of 70% or higher).

  * Calculate the percentage of students with passing math scores (scores of 70% or higher).

  * Calculate the overall passing rate (the average of the passing math and reading percentages).

* Feel free to explore further and answer additional questions from the [Jupyter notebook file](Resources/PyCitySchools_Solution.ipynb) that is included in the activity folder for your convenience.
